                                    <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
                                    <p>At Midwest Copier Exchange, we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy
                                    applies to all of the services and websites offered by Midwest Copier Exchange, LLC. or its
                                    subsidiaries or affiliated companies unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
                                    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href=

                                    <p><u>What Information Do We Collect and What For?</u></p>
                                    <p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide
                                    any personal information to us, such as our Inventory Search. In order to provide our full range
                                    of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Information you provide - When you sign up for a Midwest Account, we ask you for personal
                                        information (such as your name, email address and an account password which is maintained in
                                        encrypted form on secure servers). We may combine the information you submit under your account
                                        with information from other Midwest services or third parties in order to provide you with a
                                        better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give
                                        you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</li>
                                        <li>Cookies - When you visit Midwest, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a
                                        string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to
                                        improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as
                                        how/what people search for.</li>
                                        <li>Log information - When you access Midwest services, our servers automatically record
                                        information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include
                                        information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language,
                                        the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your
                                        browser.</li>
                                        <li>User communications - When you send email or other communications to Midwest, we may retain
                                        those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve
                                        our services.</li>
                                        <li>Affiliated sites - We offer some of our services in connection with other web sites.
                                        Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Midwest in order to deliver
                                        the service. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated
                                        sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy
                                        policies.</li>
                                        <li>Other sites - This Privacy Policy applies to Midwest services only. We do not exercise
                                        control over the sites linked from within our various services. These other sites may place
                                        their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information
                                        from you.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Midwest only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy
                                    and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such
                                    purposes include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Providing our services to users, including the display of customized content and
                                        advertising;</li>
                                        <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
                                        <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and</li>
                                        <li>Developing new services.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the
                                    supplementary privacy notices for particular services.</p>
                                    <p><u>Choices for personal information</u></p>
                                    <p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide
                                    personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which
                                    it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
                                    <p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this
                                    Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way
                                    to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or
                                    use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or
                                    in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
                                    <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse
                                    all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Midwest features and
                                    services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
                                    <p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Midwest
                                    may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
                                    <p><u>Information sharing</u></p>
                                    <p>Midwest only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of
                                    Midwest in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal
                                        information.</li>
                                        <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information
                                        is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
                                        enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including
                                        investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
                                        security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or
                                        safety of Midwest, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If Midwest becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of
                                    its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject
                                    to a different privacy policy.</p>
                                    <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such
                                    as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example. Such information does not
                                    identify you individually.</p>
                                    <p>Please contact us using the methods below for any additional questions about the management or
                                    use of personal data.</p>
                                    <p><u>Information security</u></p>
                                    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
                                    unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our
                                    data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical
                                    security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
                                    data.</p>
                                    <p>We restrict access to personal information to Midwest employees, contractors and agents who
                                    need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These
                                    individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including
                                    termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
                                    <p><u>Data integrity</u></p>
                                    <p>Midwest processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
                                    accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review
                                    our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and
                                    process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable
                                    steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but
                                    we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
                                    <p><u>Accessing and updating personal information</u></p>
                                    <p>When you use Midwest services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your
                                    personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data
                                    at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business
                                    purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be
                                    accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
                                    requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                                    effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance,
                                    requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
                                    required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service
                                    free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services
                                    have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide
                                    the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>

                                    will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the
